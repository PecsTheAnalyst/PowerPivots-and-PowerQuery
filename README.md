# PowerPivots-and-PowerQuery
This dashboard was created from scratch using powerquery and powerpivots
1. DATA CLEANING : The data was cleaned and columns renamed, deleted and converted to fit specific data types
2. DATA MODELLING : The cleaned data was then sent into powerpivot for modelling and table connections.
3. DATA ANALYSIS : The data was analysed based on questions asked that answered the problem at hand in determining the most profitable and least profitable salesperson in the regions selected.
